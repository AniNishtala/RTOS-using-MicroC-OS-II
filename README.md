The objective of this assignment is to use the NIOS II Embedded Development Software
Build Tools, also known as SBT. This SBT is for Eclipse and it will be implemented with
the custom system that was created, which are the .sof and .sopc files. The software calls
for the NIOS II processor system as well as with the EDS running on a ’host computer’.
The other requirements is an Intel FPGA and a JTAG download cable. The language that
will be used is C however the board of support packages (BSP) also comes with C/C++
runtime environment. The BSP’s also contain a hardware abstraction layer, also known
as HAL, and an RTOS along with device drivers. The importance’s is to understand the
structure as well as the set up between hardware and software. The way HAL works is to
provide a single-threaded UNIX-like C/C++ runtime environment
